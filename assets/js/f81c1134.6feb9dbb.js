But for this collaboration to succeed, we need transparency. We need to understand:\\n\\n- **What did the agent do?** Which actions were taken, which topics were matched, which data was accessed?\\n- **Why did it do that?** What reasoning led to those decisions? What context influenced the response?\\n- **How can we improve it?** Where are the bottlenecks? What optimizations are possible?\\n\\nGenAI Explorer bridges this gap. It\'s not just about chatting with AI agents\u2014it\'s about *understanding* them.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf0d Starting with Salesforce, Expanding Beyond\\n\\nWhile our initial focus is on **Salesforce Agentforce and Einstein AI**, our vision extends beyond a single platform. The principles of AI transparency, debugging, and optimization apply universally:\\n\\n- Today: Salesforce Agentforce, Einstein, Data Cloud\\n- Tomorrow: Multi-platform AI agent support\\n- Future: A unified lens for understanding any AI agent, anywhere\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 What is GenAI Explorer?\\n\\nGenAI Explorer is a browser extension designed specifically for the Salesforce AI ecosystem.

what is Salesforce Explorer ?\\n**Salesforce Explorer** is a productivity tool provided as a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-explorer/eabpolgjfkpchgffbkiedgfemcgbnbde) intended for Salesforce **administrators** and **developers**.\\nIt contains features I needed on some of my previous assignments that I decided to package.\\n\\n\\n## What is included ?\\n\\nHere is the list of the most important features provided:\\n<HomepageFeatures version=\\"0.1.0\\" />\\n\\n## But why?\\nMost of the time I started working on something because I needed it on my project and I could not find the capability in salesforce or I was not comfortable with the user experience.\\n\\n\\n## How is it built?\\nIt is built with React, Typescript and [React SLDS](https://github.com/mashmatrix/react-lightning-design-system/blob/master/README.md) to provide a salesforce like UX experience.\\n\\n\\n## Why not an Appexchange?\\nWeb extension architecture offers the following advantages\\n* First and foremost: **No need to be admin of your org to install/use it!**\\n* A single installation is enough for all your orgs\\n* React, Typescript, webpack and friends offer a better developer experience than lwc\\n* Interestingly you can access the tooling API from a web extension and in LWC to do the same you need to [a configuration with a connected app](https://salesforcecodex.com/salesforce/call-tooling-api-from-lightning-web-component/) which is more complex in my opinion\\n\\n## Is it open source?\\nNot yet, but the plan is to make it open source - code needs to be cleaned and documented first.\\n\\n## Can you use it on your project?\\nYes please try it out and let me know what you think. You can provide feedback [here](https://github.com/sf-explorer/documentation/issues)\\n\\n## Is it secure?\\nYes, like for the appexchange, chrome makes a security review for chrome extension and it has been approved"}]}}')}}]);
