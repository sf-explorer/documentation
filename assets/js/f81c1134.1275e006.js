what is Salesforce Explorer ?\\n**Salesforce Explorer** is a productivity tool provided as a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-explorer/eabpolgjfkpchgffbkiedgfemcgbnbde) intended for Salesforce **administrators** and **developers**.\\nIt contains features I needed on some of my previous assignments that I decided to package.\\n\\n\\n## What is included ?\\n\\nHere is the list of the most important features provided:\\n<HomepageFeatures version=\\"0.1.0\\" />\\n\\n## But why?\\nMost of the time I started working on something because I needed it on my project and I could not find the capability in salesforce or I was not comfortable with the user experience.\\n\\n\\n## How is it built?\\nIt is built with React, Typescript and [React SLDS](https://github.com/mashmatrix/react-lightning-design-system/blob/master/README.md) to provide a salesforce like UX experience.\\n\\n\\n## Why not an Appexchange?\\nWeb extension architecture offers the following advantages\\n* First and foremost: **No need to be admin of your org to install/use it!**\\n* A single installation is enough for all your orgs\\n* React, Typescript, webpack and friends offer a better developer experience than lwc\\n* Interestingly you can access the tooling API from a web extension and in LWC to do the same you need to [a configuration with a connected app](https://salesforcecodex.com/salesforce/call-tooling-api-from-lightning-web-component/) which is more complex in my opinion\\n\\n## Is it open source?\\nNot yet, but the plan is to make it open source - code needs to be cleaned and documented first.\\n\\n## Can you use it on your project?\\nYes please try it out and let me know what you think. You can provide feedback [here](https://github.com/sf-explorer/documentation/issues)\\n\\n## Is it secure?\\nYes, like for the appexchange, chrome makes a security review for chrome extension and it has been approved"}]}}')}}]);
