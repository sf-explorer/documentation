# Installation

For `SF Explorer` to communicate with OpenAI you need to either:

* (Beta) Activate [Einstein](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/einstein/genai/guide/access-models-api-with-apex.html) and create an Apex Class to expose a rest endpoint
* Use your own OpenAI Account: Sign up and generate an [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (it takes 2 min)

Either way, go into **Settings** (top left in SF Explorer) and copy paste your key into the openAI key field or enable Einstein.


**OpenAI** is not available with **SF Explorer Lite**
