# Architecture

SF Explorer as a web extension offers the following advantages:
* React, Typescript, webpack and friends offer a better developer experience than LWC
* A focus on UX with advanced user capabilities (excel like)
* **No need to be admin of your org to install/use it**
* A **single installation** is enough for all your orgs - and single combined UI for multiple orgs
* A security review done by the chrome/edge team
* Automatic updates
* a user experience based on the Salesforce Design System
