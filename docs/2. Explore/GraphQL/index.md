# GraphQL

## Introduction
What is GraphQL:
* Specification for API Server + Query Language - Facebook 2015
* Single endpoint for all the resources, that can be aggregated
* Requests only the necessary data
* Schema-driven, enabling introspection - metadata friendly
* Widely adopted through a fast growing community

## Usage with SF Explorer
GraphQL offers very interesting use cases for salesforce. A number of tools are available in the community and **SF Explorer** ships with a built in version of **GraphiQL** with the following advantages:
* **No need to authenticate** - as easy as it should be
* **SOQL** transition tool
* **Sample queries** to get you started  
* **LWC** Generation with the graphql `wire` adapter

To give it a try navigate to **Code** and then select **GraphQL**:

## SOQL transition tool

If you are not familiar with graphQL but you are a **SOQL ninja** ü•∑üèø, you can use the [SOQL transition tool](https://github.com/nicolas-despres/soql-to-graphql/blob/main/Readme.md):
* Write your query with **auto completion** and the syntax you know
* Generate the graphQL equivalent
