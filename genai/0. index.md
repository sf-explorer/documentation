## The Problem

**Humans and agents are meant to live together, yet we need better tools to understand what agents have done and, more importantly, why.**

As AI agents become integral to business operations, teams face key challenges:

### Understanding AI Behavior
- 🤔 **Complex Reasoning**: AI decision-making involves multiple stages and considerations
- 🔍 **Tracing Decisions**: Need to understand why agents chose specific actions or responses
- 📊 **Performance Visibility**: Token usage, timing, and quality metrics require analysis

### Testing & Validation
- 🧪 **Safe Testing**: Need controlled environments to validate agent behavior
- 🔄 **Iteration Speed**: Want to test and refine agents quickly
- 🐛 **Issue Reproduction**: Need to replay and debug specific interactions
- 📈 **Data Analysis**: AI data spans multiple objects and requires specialized queries

### Configuration Management
- 🗺️ **Component Relationships**: Understanding how agents, topics, and actions connect
- 📋 **Version Control**: Tracking which configurations are active vs. draft
- 🎯 **Impact Analysis**: Knowing what will be affected by changes

### Development Tools
- 🔧 **Specialized Needs**: AI development requires different tools than traditional Salesforce
- 💬 **Prompt Engineering**: Testing different models, prompts, and parameters
- 📊 **Analytics Access**: Analyzing conversation data for insights

**In short**: Teams need specialized tools to build, test, and optimize AI agents effectively.

- 💰 **50-70% cost reduction** - optimize model selection
- 📚 **10x faster onboarding** - visual docs and live data

## Why We Built It

**Humans and agents are meant to live together.** But for this collaboration to succeed, we need transparency.

GenAI Explorer was created by Salesforce developers and AI engineers building Agentforce implementations who needed better tooling. The project started with a simple question:

> "How can we see what's happening inside an Agentforce conversation?"

From that question came a comprehensive toolkit that answers:
- **What did the agent do?** Which actions, topics, and data?
- **Why did it do that?** What reasoning led to those decisions?
- **How can we improve it?** Where are bottlenecks and optimization opportunities?

### Our Vision

**Today:** Salesforce Agentforce, Einstein, Data Cloud  
**Tomorrow:** Multi-platform AI agent support  
**Future:** A unified lens for understanding any AI agent, anywhere

**The goal:** Make AI agent behavior transparent and understandable, regardless of platform.
