## Features & Capabilities

### What can I do with GenAI Explorer?

**Core Features:**
- Chat with Agentforce agents in real-time
- Test Einstein AI models
- Visualize the Atlas reasoning pipeline
- Execute Data Cloud queries
- Browse agent configurations
- Create visual documentation boards

### Can I create or modify agents?

No, GenAI Explorer is a read-only exploration tool. To create or modify agents, use Salesforce Setup. However, you can:
- View all agent configurations
- Test agent behavior
- Document agent design
- Export configurations

### Does it support custom AI models?

GenAI Explorer works with Einstein-supported models:
- GPT-4 Omni
- GPT-4o Mini
- GPT-3.5 Turbo

Custom or external models aren't currently supported.

### Can I share boards with my team?

Yes, you can:
- Export boards as JSON files
- Export as images (PNG, JPEG, SVG)
- Share files via email or collaboration tools
- Others can import JSON files

## Data & Privacy

### Where is my data stored?

**Local Storage:**
- Boards and preferences stored in browser
- No data sent to external servers

**Salesforce Storage:**
- All query results from your Salesforce org
- AI conversations stored in Data Cloud
- No data stored outside your control

### Does GenAI Explorer collect my data?

No. GenAI Explorer:
- Does NOT collect personal information
- Does NOT send data to external servers (outside our heroku server to overcome cors)
- Only connects directly to your Salesforce org

### Is my Salesforce data secure?

Yes:
- Uses official Salesforce OAuth authentication
- All connections are encrypted (HTTPS)
- No data stored externally
- Follows Salesforce security best practices


## Chat & Agents

### Why aren't my agents responding?

Common reasons:
- Agent is inactive in Salesforce
- Missing required session variables
- No topics configured for the query
- API limits exceeded
- Network connectivity issues

See [FAQ](./9-faq.md) for more solutions.

### Can I test agents in sandbox?

Yes! GenAI Explorer works with:
- Production orgs
- Sandbox orgs
- Scratch orgs
- Developer orgs

### How do session variables work?

Session variables provide context for the entire conversation:

**Example:**
```json
{
  "customerId": "001xx000003D8E5",
  "accountType": "Premium"
}
```

The agent uses these throughout the session without you repeating them.

### What are cited references?

Cited references show the sources the agent used to generate its response:
- Knowledge articles
- Salesforce records
- External data sources
- API responses

This helps verify accuracy and understand reasoning.


## Data Cloud & Queries

### Do I need Data Cloud to use GenAI Explorer?

Not for all features:

**Requires Data Cloud:**
- Query Lab
- Performance analytics
- Token usage reports
- Conversation threading analysis

**Works Without Data Cloud:**
- Chat with agents
- Model testing
- Configuration browser
- Interactive boards (most features)

### How do I access Data Cloud?

Contact your Salesforce administrator to:
1. Enable Data Cloud in your org
2. Grant you Data Cloud User permission
3. Set up required permissions on AI objects

### Why are my queries slow?

**Common Causes:**
- Missing date filters
- Too many JOINs
- Large result sets
- Unindexed fields

**Solutions:**
- Always filter by `CreatedDate`
- Use `LIMIT` clause
- Query indexed fields
- See [Data Cloud Integration](./data-cloud-integration) for optimization tips

### Can I query custom objects?

Yes, if they're available in Data Cloud. Use standard SOQL syntax with the correct API names.

## Model Testing

### Why do I get different results each time?

This is normal AI behavior controlled by the temperature parameter:

**Temperature = 0.0:**
- Most deterministic
- Consistent results

**Temperature = 0.7:**
- Balanced creativity
- Some variation

**Temperature = 1.5:**
- Very creative
- Highly variable

### How much do model tests cost?

Each test consumes Einstein AI credits based on:
- Model used (GPT-4 costs more than GPT-3.5)
- Token count (input + output)
- Your org's Einstein pricing

Check token usage in the results panel.

### Can I test with production data?

Yes, but be careful:
- Don't expose PII in prompts
- Test in sandbox first for sensitive scenarios
- Monitor token usage to control costs
- Follow your organization's data policies

### What's the difference between the models?

| Model | Speed | Cost | Quality | Best For |
|-------|-------|------|---------|----------|
| GPT-4 Omni | Slower | Higher | Best | Complex reasoning |
| GPT-4o Mini | Fast | Medium | High | General purpose |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo | Fastest | Lower | Good | Simple tasks |

## Boards & Visualization

### How many boards can I create?

Limited only by browser storage (typically ~10MB). Most users can create 50-100 boards depending on complexity.

### Can I embed live data in boards?

Yes! Use Query Nodes to:
- Execute SOQL queries
- Display live results
- Auto-refresh data
- Export updated data

### What is the Board Prompt Engine?

An AI-powered feature that lets you modify boards using natural language:

**Example Commands:**
- "Add a markdown node at (100, 100)"
- "Arrange all nodes in a grid"
- "Connect the agent node to the topics"

### How do I backup my boards?

**Best Practice:**
1. Click "Export" on each board
2. Save as JSON file
3. Store in version control or backup location
4. Re-import if needed

## Performance & Limits

### Are there API limits?

Yes, GenAI Explorer uses Salesforce APIs, which have limits:

**Typical Limits:**
- 15,000-100,000 API calls per day (depends on edition)
- Data Cloud query limits
- Einstein AI credit limits

The extension monitors usage and warns at 80% capacity.

### Why is the extension slow?

**For Web Application:**
**Common Causes:**
- Slow network connection
- Large boards with many nodes
- Auto-refreshing queries
- Browser with limited resources

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Simplify boards
- Disable auto-refresh
