## Hybrid Strategy

### Best Practice: Use Multiple Models

**Route requests to the appropriate model based on complexity:**

```javascript
function selectModel(request) {
  if (isComplex(request)) {
    return "GPT-4o";          // 10% of requests
  } else if (isStandard(request)) {
    return "GPT-4o-Mini";     // 60% of requests
  } else {
    return "Claude-3-Haiku";  // 30% of requests
  }
}
```

**Example Results:**
- Average cost per request: $0.008 (vs $0.030 with GPT-4o only)
- **Savings: 73%** while maintaining quality where needed
- **Environmental Impact**: ~85% reduction in CO₂ emissions vs using GPT-4o for all requests

4. **Scale test:** Try with 100+ variations
5. **Measure:** Track success rate
6. **Decide:** Choose the right model for each use case type

### Success Criteria

Define what "good enough" means:
- Customer support: 90% quality acceptable
- Legal analysis: 99% quality required
- Data classification: 95% accuracy needed
- Content generation: 85% quality acceptable
